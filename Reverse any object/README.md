# Reverse String using Stack

## Overview
This Python script demonstrates how to reverse a string using a stack data structure. The script defines a function called `reverse_string()` which takes an input string and returns its reverse.

## Approach
1. **Push onto Stack**: Iterate through the input string and push each character onto a stack.
2. **Pop from Stack**: Pop each character from the stack and append it to a new string, effectively reversing the original string.

## Time Complexity
- **Push Operation**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
- **Pop Operation**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

## Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string, due to the space required by the stack to store the characters.
