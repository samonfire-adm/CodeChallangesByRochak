## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find solutions to DSA questions from various platforms such as LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeSignal, and more. Each problem is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the problem statement, followed by one or more approaches to solve it efficiently.

## Problem Statements

Here's a list of some of the DSA questions we've solved:

- [Problem 1: Coca Cola](Coca-Cola/README.md)
- [Problem 2: Reverse a Linked List](problems/reverse-linked-list.md)
- [Problem 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters.md)
- [Problem 4: Maximum Subarray](problems/maximum-subarray.md)
- [Problem 5: Merge Intervals](problems/merge-intervals.md)

...and many more!

Each problem statement includes a detailed description of the problem to solve.

## Approaches

For each problem, we provide one or more approaches to solve it. These approaches are explained step by step, helping you understand the thought process behind solving the problem efficiently.

## Video Solutions

We understand that some learners prefer visual explanations. That's why we provide video solutions for select problems. You can find these video solutions on our YouTube channel.
