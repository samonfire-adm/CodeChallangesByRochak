# Write A Python Program To Take Age From The User To Check Whether User Able To Participate In Voting Or Not. If Age Is Less Than 18 Then It Don't Allow To Participation. And Show, After How Much Year A Person Will Be Able To Participate:

## Problem Description

Create a Python program that determines whether a user is eligible to participate in voting based on their age. The program should prompt the user to enter their age, then check if they meet the minimum age requirement for voting. If the user's age is less than 18, the program should inform them that they are not eligible to vote and calculate the number of years remaining until they become eligible. If the user's age is 18 or older, the program should confirm their eligibility to vote.

### Detailed Requirements

1. **Input**:
   - The program should prompt the user to enter their age (an integer).

2. **Processing**:
   - The program should evaluate whether the entered age is less than 18.
   - If the age is less than 18, the program should calculate how many years are left until the user turns 18.

3. **Output**:
   - If the age is less than 18, the program should display a message: "You are not eligible to vote. You will be eligible in X years.", where X is the number of years remaining until the user turns 18.
   - If the age is 18 or older, the program should display a message: "You are eligible to vote."

### Example

**Input:**
```
Enter your age: 16
```

**Output:**
```
You are not eligible to vote. You will be eligible in 2 years.
```

**Input:**
```
Enter your age: 20
```

**Output:**
```
You are eligible to vote.
```

### Additional Considerations

- Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully, such as non-numeric values.
- Optionally, the program could include additional information, such as congratulatory messages for new eligible voters or general voting information.

This problem requires basic user input handling, conditional logic, and output formatting to provide clear and informative feedback to the user about their voting eligibility.

### Write A Python Program To Take Marks From The User To Check Whether User Able To Admission In College Or Not. If Marks Is Less Than 60 Then It Don't Allow To Take Admission. 


## Problem Description

Create a Python program that evaluates whether a user qualifies for admission to a college based on their marks. The program should prompt the user to enter their marks, then check if the marks meet the minimum threshold for admission. If the marks are less than 60, the program should display a message indicating that the user is not eligible for admission. Otherwise, it should confirm that the user is eligible.

### Detailed Requirements

1. **Input**:
   - The program should prompt the user to enter their marks (an integer or float).

2. **Processing**:
   - The program should evaluate whether the entered marks are less than 60.

3. **Output**:
   - If the marks are less than 60, the program should display a message: "You are not eligible for admission."
   - If the marks are 60 or above, the program should display a message: "You are eligible for admission."

### Example

**Input:**
```
Enter your marks: 55
```

**Output:**
```
You are not eligible for admission.
```

**Input:**
```
Enter your marks: 75
```

**Output:**
```
You are eligible for admission.
```

### Additional Considerations

- Ensure the program handles invalid inputs gracefully, such as non-numeric values.
- Optionally, you can add functionality to check for borderline cases or offer additional advice based on the marks.


This boilerplate includes a try-except block to handle non-numeric input and provides the core logic to determine eligibility based on the entered marks.
