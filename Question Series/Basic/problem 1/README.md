# Write a Python program to display a table of numbers and their squares in a specific layout.

The program should generate a table with two columns: "Numbers" and "Square". Each row in the table should display a number and its square. Here is the expected output format:

| Number 	| Square 	|
|--------	|--------	|
| 1      	| 1      	|
| 2      	| 4      	|
| 3      	| 9      	|

The function generate_table(n) takes an integer n as an argument, which specifies the range of numbers to display.
It prints the headers "Numbers" and "Square" with a fixed width using formatted strings.
It then iterates through the range from 1 to n, printing each number and its square in a tabular format.
