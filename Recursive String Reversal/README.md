# Title: Recursive String Reversal

## Question:
Ever wondered how to reverse a string without using loops? Well, I had one of those moments while pondering the mysteries of programming. Sitting with my cup of coffee, I contemplated how to reverse a string using recursion. Suddenly, it struck me: why not break down the problem into smaller parts and tackle it recursively? So here's the plan...

## Description:
Imagine you have a string that needs to be reversed. Now, instead of using loops or built-in reverse functions, we'll take a more adventurous route: recursion! We'll break down the string into smaller substrings, reverse each substring, and then combine them to form the final reversed string. It's like solving a puzzle, one piece at a time!

## Input Format:
- The function takes a single parameter `s`, which represents the input string to be reversed.

## Output Format:
- The function returns the reversed string.

## Constraints:
- The length of the input string can vary.
- The input string can contain any characters, including special characters and whitespace.

## Sample:

| Input             | Output        |
|-------------------|---------------|
| "Hello, World!"   | "!dlroW ,olleH" |

## Explanation:
Imagine the input string as a puzzle that needs to be solved. We'll start by breaking it down into smaller pieces (substrings), reversing each piece recursively, and then assembling them back together to form the final reversed string. It's like putting together a jigsaw puzzle, but with strings!
