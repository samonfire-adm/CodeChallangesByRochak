# Problem Statement
### Two players, Rishi and Sam, each roll a six-sided dice three times. The results of these rolls form a series of three numbers for each player. The task is to determine the sum of the two greatest numbers from these series for each player. The player with the highest sum wins the game. If both players have the same sum, the game is a tie.

#### Examples
- Rishi's rolls: [3, 2, 5]
- Sam's rolls: [4, 3, 1]

For Rishi:
- Greatest two numbers: 3 and 5
- Sum: 3 + 5 = 8

For Sam:
- Greatest two numbers: 4 and 3
- Sum: 4 + 3 = 7

Since Rishi's sum is greater, Rishi wins.

## Detailed Explanation and Approach
1. **Input**: Two lists of integers, each containing the results of three dice rolls for Rishi and Sam.
2. **Find Two Greatest Numbers**: For each player's list, sort the list and pick the last two elements (which are the greatest).
3. **Calculate Sum**: Compute the sum of these two numbers for both players.
4. **Determine Winner**: Compare the sums to determine the winner or if the game is a tie.

##### Python Solution

```python
def determine_winner(rishi_rolls, sam_rolls):
    rishi_rolls.sort()
    rishi_sum = rishi_rolls[-1] + rishi_rolls[-2]
    sam_rolls.sort()
    sam_sum = sam_rolls[-1] + sam_rolls[-2]

    if rishi_sum > sam_sum:
        return "Rishi wins with a sum of {}".format(rishi_sum)
    elif sam_sum > rishi_sum:
        return "Sam wins with a sum of {}".format(sam_sum)
    else:
        return "The game is a tie with a sum of {}".format(rishi_sum)


rishi_rolls = [3, 2, 5]
sam_rolls = [4, 3, 1]
result = determine_winner(rishi_rolls, sam_rolls)
print(result)

```
### Explanation of the Code
1. **Sorting**: Each player's rolls are sorted to easily find the two greatest numbers.
2. **Finding Maximum Sum**: The two greatest numbers are taken from the sorted list, and their sum is calculated.
3. **Comparing Sums**: The sums are compared to determine the winner or if the game is tied.

### Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: Sorting each player's rolls takes 𝑂(𝑘log𝑘), where 𝑘 is the number of rolls per player (3 in this case). Thus, the overall time complexity is 𝑂(2𝑘log𝑘) which simplifies to 𝑂(𝑘log𝑘)
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is 𝑂(1) since we are only using a constant amount of additional space.
